First, you need to have the terminal software. Then, you need to have a account on github.com. Github.com example - email1234-cmis

Second, you make a same respository file but just add 'wd' at the end. For example : email1234-cmis-wd

Third, you go into your respositor page and there will be a url at the botto right, just copy that file.

Fourth, open terminal, and paste your url/clone, into terminal. Cloning is for gathering information of the website to connect with terminal. (Shift Insert is how you paste in terminal.)

Fifth, You can check if you are in your account by typing 'ls'.

Next, you need to get into your folder, by doing that, you have to enter 'cd email1234-cmis-wd', and you'll be in your folder.

Sixth,you can make a text file by entering 'gedit 'and your file name'.' And your text file should pop up, and start your typing!

Seventh, after you finish typing, you enter 'git add 'name of your file'.'

Eighth, enter 'git commit -m 'type in what you did on the file'.' Then your terminal should start to process.

Ninth, you enter 'git push'. It will tell you to enter your github username, and your password. Your password will not be shown, just to keep it private.

Finally, everything should process, and everything is done!
